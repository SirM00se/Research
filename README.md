This repository contains all of the code used for my study over the impact of major injuries on hitting value in the MLB. This repository also contains all data generated by this study. 
The files that contain values used to generate final before and after wOBA files are those titled bef(body part)2.csv or aft(body part)2.csv. There are other files that end without 2 or with G, and these files have incorrect data.
backup.csv was used to store data in case my program encountered an error. The on(body part).csv and off(body part).csv contain the list of players who suffered a major injury to that area of the body. 
The people.csv files contain identifiers for players in Fangraphs. The transactions_data.csv files contain players who were moved to and from the injured list. These lists get increasingly narrow as new parameters for what players should be listed are introduced.
Finally, the test.py files are those used for the generation of data.
